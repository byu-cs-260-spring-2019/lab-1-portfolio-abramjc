                <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
                <p>Person stuff.</p>
                <img id="me" class="rounded float-right img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/95R7ZWi.jpg" alt="A picture of me on a mountain" height="408" width="306" >
                <h5 id="basics">The Basics</h5>
                <p>My name is Abram Clements. I'm from Eagle Mountain, Utah,
                though I'd rather be from Oregon, because I think it's absolutely 
                beautiful there! I love the beaches, forests, and mountains!
                One of my favorite things to do is to go hiking. I am a student
                at Brigham Young University, studying Computer Science. In high school
                and junior high I thought I was going to study Music. I was in 
                my school band and choir as well as an extra-curricular symphony and choir. 
                I took private lessons on brass and piano. I was really into music. 
                I still am, but I don't perform or practice anywhere near as much as 
                I used to. It was my Senior year in high school and on my mission when I 
                felt like I was supposed to study something else, and after lots of 
                consideration and thinking, I decided on computer science. </p>

                <p>I come from a fairly big family. I am the oldest of seven kids,
                I have four younger sisters and two younger brothers (who were born 
                on the same day 12 years apart btw). My siblings are awesome, crazy,
                and so much fun! I get excited every time I get to see them, because
                they really are wonderful people.</p>

                <h5 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h5>
                <p>I've already mentioned my top hobby. Hiking. I love hiking! I am
                always on the lookout for new hikes, so if you have any hikes you love 
                please share them with me. It is one of my lifelong dreams to go on a
                backpacking trip across Europe. One of my favorite hikes is Timpanogos Peak.
                The hike itself is long, but the view is absolutely breath-taking. It's
                been a few years since I've done it, but hopefully I'll find the time this
                summer. I want to wake up early and hike Timpanogos, so I can see a sunrise
                from the top.</p>

                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aSErbPy.jpg" alt="sunset panorama" class="img-fluid">
                
                <p>I also love sunrises, sunsets, and mountains. The picture above is a 
                panorama I took a few miles outside Zions National Park. There is something so 
                refreshing about waking up in time to see the sun rise above the mountains, 
                and some of the best conversations of my life have taken place while sitting
                outside and watching the sun set. I'm pretty sure that about half of the 
                pictures I take involve a sunrise or a sunset. </p>

                <p>Basketball is another one of my hobbies. We had a basketball court in our
                backyard growing up, so I spent many hours practicing, and playing speed, horse,
                revenge, poision, and basketball with my friends growing up. I also enjoy a
                game of volleyball on occasion. Soccer is fun, even though I pretty much 
                one hundred percent suck at it.</p>

                <p>3D modeling and animation is another hobby of mine. It is my newest hobby.
                I started getting into it a couple of months ago. It made me reconsider my 
                major, but I don't know if I would like to do it full time. I really like 
                doing it on occasion though, in my free time. I'm pretty new, so I don't have
                very much to show for it, but I can spend hours working on it and completely
                lose track of time. </p>

                <p>I wasn't kidding about the sunset photos, I really do love them.</p>
